# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

SQUARE-Payments/Billing

Square, Inc. is an American financial services, merchant services aggregator, and mobile payment company based in San Francisco, California.  The company markets software and hardware payment products and has expanded into small business services.  It allows its sellers to start, run, and grow their businesses.  It combines software with hardware to enable sellers to turn mobile devices and computing devices into point-of-sale solutions.  Square was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey, who is also the co-founder and CEO of Twitter.  The idea for Square first came about when a friend of Dorsey's was unable to make a sale because he couldn't process an American Express card.  The two realized they should build a system where anyone can accept credit card payments using a smartphone.  Dorsey then went on to launch mobile payments service Square in October 2010. 

        In an interview, Dorsey said “Payment is another form of communication...but it’s never been treated as such. It’s never been designed. It’s never felt magical. About 90 percent of Americans carry cards, but almost nobody can accept them. We want to balance that out and just make payments feel amazing."

Square received seven rounds of private funding before going public in November 2015. Major investors included Acequia Capital, Sequoia Capital, and Khosla Partners.  On November 19, 2015, Square's shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange for $9 per share, with a company valuation of $2.9 billion.  By Aug. 18, 2020, Square's market capitalization grew to $66.5 billion and traded above $151 per share.  In November 2017, the Square Cash App announced a trial program that availed bitcoin trading to certain users, which spiked the company's stock price to a record high of $48.86 per share. On March 12, 2018, the stock reached another record high of $54.89 per share, following news that the company was extending its bitcoin trading services to Wyoming.  On April 26, 2018, Square announced its acquisition of San Francisco-based Weebly, a website construction service and web hosting service company. Square acquired food delivery service Caviar in August 2014. It then became the first company to own both a food delivery company and a point-of-sale service, after launching Square for Restaurants in May 2018. Caviar was sold to DoorDash in 2019 for $410 million.  

By combining an elegant integrated payments system with a distinctive conversation-triggering piece of hardware, Square has disrupted the credit card payments establishment while making credit card processing more accessible to small businesses everywhere. It allows sellers of all sizes to accept payments, create and track orders, maange a product catalog, organize customers, adjust inventory, and manage employees.  

Square charges merchants 2.60% of the sales price plus 10 cents of any transaction they process via swipe, insert, or tap, and it charges 3.5% plus 15 cents for every manually keyed-in transaction. Square POS lets customers pay, tip, and sign on a merchant's mobile phone or tablet, and lets merchants process payments made with credit cards, gift cards, and cash.  Business owners can also use the app to send and track invoices, customize products, email receipts, apply discounts, administer refunds, access real-time sales data, and track inventory in real-time.

Square's initial target market might be small independent vendors, mom-and-pop stores, etc. but eventually their market will include anyone who physically accepts payments in any form. Sure, a small difference in fees alone is unlikely to make a current users adopt Square. However, Square is likely to provide a bunch of value on top of just the payment gateway, which will be the incentive for vendors to eventually switch. Currently, square offers ease of integration and customer analytics with a dependence on 3G/ wi-fi.  Types of businesses that they work with include but are not limited to coffee shops, retail, bars & lounges, beauty professionals, health and fitness, and home and repair services.

Square continues to stay in the forefront of its domain as it developed Square Cash App, a mobile payment service that allows users to transfer money to one another using a mobile phone app.  In 2017, the company's Square Cash App began allowing merchants to use Bitcoin in the technology.  To prevent fraud and identity theft, Square has introduced encryption technology on its devices, which do not store card numbers, security codes, or magnetic stripe data.  Square's technology uses APIs and SDKs, which are free for developers to use.  Their payment APIs include end-to-end encryption, dispute management, fast deposits for sellers, and fraud detection.  Square has apparently been open sourcing a lot of projects, and has more info on its GitHub and tech blog called The Corner.  Links are below in the references section.  

Square is involved in the payment and billing domain of the financial industry.  Over the last 5-10 years, many point of sale solutions have allowed business owners to harness the power of smart devices to convert them into fully functional points of sale.  Along with Square, some other major companies in the payment and billing domain are Intuit QuickBooks GoPayment, PayPal Here, ShopKeep, Clover, and Shopify.  Point of sales has impacted the economy by empowering sellers of all sizes to start, run, and grow their businesses.  Some metrics that Fintech companies in payment and billing may use to measure success are the number of companies utlizing their POS system to fulfill their business needs.  It is easy to calculate how much in dollar sales a Square POS system is involved in because it's pricing structure is 2.6% + 0.10 cents every time a sale is made.  

Some of Square's competitors are Intuit GoPayment, Paypal Here, ShopKeep, Clover, and Shopify.  Intuit GoPayment’s fee structure may work better than Square’s for businesses that typically process larger transactions.  Though Intuit GoPayment offers simpler mobile POS solutions than Square does, it can easily integrate to QuickBooks accounting software which is a game-changer for many business owners.  PayPal Here typically works best as a supplement to an already-used business PayPal account.  It doesn't offer a free card reader, and best serves business owners who already rely heavily on PayPal for their payment processing. ShopKeep is priced using a completely quote-based system, but offers a register, real-time transaction analytics, employee management, unlimited inventory items, and more in one software package.  Clover does not require sellers to have a smart device at their disposal but is similar to Square.  They cover a wide range--from a simple card reader to a fully functioning countertop system.  If you don’t have a smart device and would have to purchase one for a Square POS system, then a Clover POS system could save you money.  Shopify is considered the most ecommerce-enabled.  With every version of Shopify—Lite, Basic, Regular, Advanced, and Plus—sellers will be able to access payment gateways for their business’s website and social media accounts.  If sellers scale up past Lite, sellers will also be able to access all they need for an in-person POS system, such as a cash drawer, a receipt printer, a barcode scanner, etc.

Moving forward, they could offer something similar to Clover that does not require the seller to have a smart device.  This might be an attractive option to sellers that do not currently have a smart device and would have to purchase one for a Square's POS system.  This would benefit the company because it will be a cheaper option for small, individual sellers that cannot afford to purchase a smart device dedicated solely to the business.  This would use Square's existing technology
